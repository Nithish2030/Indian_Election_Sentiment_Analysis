Project Name: Indian_Election_Sentiment_Analysis
Dataset: Twitter Tweets

NLP Techniques Used:

Preprocessing: Applied standard NLP preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization to clean and prepare the Twitter tweets dataset.
Sentiment Score Analysis: Calculated sentiment scores for each tweet to determine the polarity (positive or negative) of the sentiments expressed, excluding neutral tweets from further analysis.
Machine Learning Models Employed:

Naive Bayes Classifier: Used to classify the sentiment of the tweets based on probabilistic methods.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): Implemented to enhance prediction accuracy through margin maximization techniques.
Final Output:

Employed an Ensemble Method combining predictions from both Naive Bayes and SVM models to improve overall sentiment classification accuracy for the Indian election tweets dataset.
This project effectively analyzed the sentiments of tweets related to the Indian elections, leveraging preprocessing and sentiment analysis techniques, and utilized advanced machine learning models to predict sentiments with high accuracy through ensemble learning.
